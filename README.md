not sure if adorable, or horrifying

Starfish Cat is an adorable fluffy cat on top and a terrifying rubbery starfish on the bottom. This little guy was built to mix cues of familiar attachment and unfamiliar repulsion. Starfish Cat meows pitifully when it senses that a warm thing is nearby. It kneads its urgent tiny claws in the direction of warmth. When it senses that it is on a warm, likely human body, it begins to purr and suckle.

Starfish Cat has five IR temperature sensors in his feet and five servos actuating his tiny claws. The IR temperature libraries have been adapted from a version of the [Adafruit MLX90614 libraries](https://github.com/jspiro/Adafruit-MLX90614-Library) edited for Particle by jspiro.
